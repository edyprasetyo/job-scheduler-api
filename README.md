## Introduction

Job scheduling is a crucial part of many applications. The Job Scheduler API project offers a robust platform for managing and scheduling jobs in a clean and organized manner. The use of the Gin framework provides a performant HTTP server, while Go Wire simplifies dependency injection, and GORM facilitates database interactions.

## Features

- Create, update, and delete job schedules.
- Schedule jobs to run at specific intervals.
- Handle job execution and result tracking.
- Follows the clean architecture design pattern for maintainability and scalability.

## Technologies
